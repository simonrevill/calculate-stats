# Calculate Stats

Your task is to process a sequence of integer numbers to determine the following statistics:

- minimum value
- maximum value
- number of elements in the sequence
- average value

For example: [6, 9, 15, -2, 92, 11]

- minimum value = -2
- maximum value = 92
- number of elements in the sequence = 6
- average value = 21.833333

If you try to calculate the statistics of an empty sequence, it should throw an exception or otherwise return immediately with the message “sequence is empty”.
